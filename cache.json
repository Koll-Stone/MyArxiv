With the\nGr\\\"obner basis we can simplify cryptanalysis since we do not need to impose\ngenericity assumptions anymore to derive complexity estimations. For Hydra,\nwith the help of a computer algebra program like SageMath we construct a DRL\nGr\\\"obner basis for the iterated model via linear transformations and a linear\nchange of coordinates. In the Hydra proposal it was claimed that $r_\\mathcal{H}\n= 31$ rounds are sufficient to provide $128$ bits of security against Gr\\\"obner\nbasis attacks for an ideal adversary with $\\omega = 2$.

Generative linguistic\nsteganography leverages the probability distribution of language models (LMs)\nand applies steganographic algorithms to generate stego tokens, gaining\nattention with recent Large Language Model (LLM) advancements. To enhance\nsecurity, researchers develop distribution-preserving stego algorithms to\nminimize the gap between stego sampling and LM sampling. However, the reliance\non language model distributions, coupled with deviations from real-world cover\ntexts, results in insufficient imperceptibility when facing steganalysis\ndetectors in real-world scenarios. Moreover, LLM distributions tend to be more\ndeterministic, resulting in reduced entropy and, consequently, lower embedding\ncapacity. In this paper, we propose FreStega, a plug-and-play method to\nreconstruct the distribution of language models used for generative linguistic\nsteganography. FreStega dynamically adjusts token probabilities from the\nlanguage model at each step of stegotext auto-regressive generation, leveraging\nboth sequential and spatial dimensions. In sequential adjustment, the\ntemperature is dynamically adjusted based on instantaneous entropy, enhancing\nthe diversity of stego texts and boosting embedding capacity. In the spatial\ndimension, the distribution is aligned with guidance from the target domain\ncorpus, closely mimicking real cover text in the target domain. By reforming\nthe distribution, FreStega enhances the imperceptibility of stego text in\npractical scenarios and improves steganographic capacity by 15.41\\%, all\nwithout compromising the quality of the generated text.

The goal of alignment is to finetune a reference\nmodel such that the win rate of a sample from the aligned model over a sample\nfrom the reference model is high, subject to a KL divergence constraint. Today,\nwe are increasingly using inference-time algorithms (e.g., Best-of-N,\ncontrolled decoding, tree search) to decode from language models rather than\nstandard sampling. However, the alignment objective does not capture such\ninference-time decoding procedures. We show that the existing alignment\nframework is sub-optimal in view of such inference-time methods. We then modify\nthe alignment objective and propose a framework for inference-aware alignment\n(IAPO). We prove that for any inference-time decoding algorithm, the optimal\nsolution that optimizes the inference-time win rate of the aligned policy\nagainst the reference policy is the solution to the typical RLHF problem with a\ntransformation of the reward. This motivates us to provide the KL-regularized\ncalibrate-and-transform RL (CTRL) algorithm to solve this problem, which\ninvolves a reward calibration step and a KL-regularized reward maximization\nstep with a transformation of the calibrated reward. We particularize our study\nto two important inference-time strategies: best-of-N sampling and best-of-N\njailbreaking, where N responses are sampled from the model and the one with the\nhighest or lowest reward is selected.

However, existing ISAC\nsystems are based on fixed-position antennas (FPAs), which inevitably incur a\nloss in performance when balancing the trade-off between sensing and\ncommunication. Movable antenna (MA) technology offers promising potential to\nenhance ISAC performance by enabling flexible antenna movement. Nevertheless,\nexploiting more spatial channel variations requires larger antenna moving\nregions, which may invalidate the conventional far-field assumption for\nchannels between transceivers. Therefore, this paper utilizes the MA to enhance\nsensing and communication capabilities in near-field ISAC systems, where a\nfull-duplex base station (BS) is equipped with multiple transmit and receive\nMAs movable in large-size regions to simultaneously sense multiple targets and\nserve multiple uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) users for communication.

Previous studies used\nmeta-classifier-based membership inference attacks~(MIAs) with multi-layer\nperceptrons~(MLPs) to estimate privacy risks in location data, including when\nprotected by differential privacy (DP). In this work, however, we show that a\nsignificant gap exists between the expected attack accuracy given by DP and the\nempirical attack accuracy even with informed attackers (also known as DP\nattackers), indicating a potential underestimation of the privacy risk. To\nexplore the potential causes for the observed gap, we first propose two new\nmetric-based MIAs: the one-threshold attack and the two-threshold attack. We\nevaluate their performances on real-world location data and find that different\ndata distributions require different attack strategies for optimal performance:\nthe one-threshold attack is more effective with Gaussian DP noise, while the\ntwo-threshold attack performs better with Laplace DP noise. Comparing their\nperformance with one of the MLP-based attack models in previous works shows\nthat the MLP only learns the one-threshold rule, leading to a suboptimal\nperformance under the Laplace DP noise and an underestimation of the privacy\nrisk. Second, we theoretically prove that MLPs can encode complex rules~(\\eg,\nthe two-threshold attack rule), which can be learned when given a substantial\namount of training data. We conclude by discussing the implications of our\nfindings in practice, including broader applications extending beyond location\naggregates to any differentially private datasets containing multiple\nobservations per individual and how techniques such as synthetic data\ngeneration and pre-training might enable MLP to learn more complex optimal\nrules.\n","authors":["Yuhan Liu","Florent Guepin","Igor Shilov","Yves-Alexandre De Montjoye"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20456v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20447v1","updated":"2024-12-29T12:09:19Z","published":"2024-12-29T12:09:19Z","title":"Cool, But What About Oracles?

However, under high-mobility scenarios, frequent uplink\nchannel estimation is needed due to channel aging. Additionally, large amounts\nof antennas and subcarriers result in high-dimensional CSI matrices,\naggravating pilot training overhead. To address this, we propose a three-domain\n(3D) channel extrapolation framework across spatial, frequency, and temporal\ndomains. First, considering the effectiveness of traditional knowledge-driven\nchannel estimation methods and the marginal effects of pilots in the spatial\nand frequency domains, a knowledge-and-data driven spatial-frequency channel\nextrapolation network (KDD-SFCEN) is proposed for uplink channel estimation via\njoint spatial-frequency channel extrapolation to reduce spatial-frequency\ndomain pilot overhead. Then, leveraging channel reciprocity and temporal\ndependencies, we propose a temporal uplink-downlink channel extrapolation\nnetwork (TUDCEN) powered by generative artificial intelligence for slot-level\nchannel extrapolation, aiming to reduce the tremendous temporal domain pilot\noverhead caused by high mobility.

In this work, we demonstrate such a solution with\nquantum one-time tokens.\n  A quantum one-time token is a quantum state that permits a certain program to\nbe evaluated exactly once. One-time security guarantees, roughly, that the\ntoken cannot be used to evaluate the program more than once. We propose a\nscheme for building quantum one-time tokens for any randomized classical\nprogram, which include generative AI models.

A\nbasic operation in ISEA is for a fusion center to acquire and fuse features of\nspatial sensing data distributed at many edge devices (known as agents), which\nis confronted by a communication bottleneck due to multiple access over hostile\nwireless channels. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, called\nSpatial Over-the-Air Fusion (Spatial AirFusion), which exploits radio waveform\nsuperposition to aggregate spatially sparse features over the air and thereby\nenables simultaneous access. The framework supports simultaneous aggregation\nover multiple voxels, which partition the 3D sensing region, and across\nmultiple subcarriers. It exploits both spatial feature sparsity with channel\ndiversity to pair voxel-level aggregation tasks and subcarriers to maximize the\nminimum receive signal-to-noise ratio among voxels. Optimally solving the\nresultant mixed-integer problem of Voxel-Carrier Pairing and Power Allocation\n(VoCa-PPA) is a focus of this work.

A conventional approach to improve\ncalibration is the application of Bayesian ensembling.

This paper proposes an\nextension of variational inference (VI)-based Bayesian learning that integrates\ncalibration regularization for improved ID performance, confidence minimization\nfor OOD detection, and selective calibration to ensure a synergistic use of\ncalibration regularization and confidence minimization. The scheme is\nconstructed successively by first introducing calibration-regularized Bayesian\nlearning (CBNN), then incorporating out-of-distribution confidence minimization\n(OCM) to yield CBNN-OCM, and finally integrating also selective calibration to\nproduce selective CBNN-OCM (SCBNN-OCM).

Their natural integration, termed\nintegrated sensing and edge AI (ISEA), promises to create a platform that\nenables intelligent environment perception for wide-ranging applications. A\nbasic operation in ISEA is for a fusion center to acquire and fuse features of\nspatial sensing data distributed at many edge devices (known as agents), which\nis confronted by a communication bottleneck due to multiple access over hostile\nwireless channels. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, called\nSpatial Over-the-Air Fusion (Spatial AirFusion), which exploits radio waveform\nsuperposition to aggregate spatially sparse features over the air and thereby\nenables simultaneous access. The framework supports simultaneous aggregation\nover multiple voxels, which partition the 3D sensing region, and across\nmultiple subcarriers. It exploits both spatial feature sparsity with channel\ndiversity to pair voxel-level aggregation tasks and subcarriers to maximize the\nminimum receive signal-to-noise ratio among voxels. Optimally solving the\nresultant mixed-integer problem of Voxel-Carrier Pairing and Power Allocation\n(VoCa-PPA) is a focus of this work. The proposed approach hinges on derivations\nof optimal power allocation as a closed-form function of voxel-carrier pairing\nand a useful property of VoCa-PPA that allows dramatic solution space\nreduction.
